# Lung Cancer Data Visualization & Analysis

This project explores lifestyle factors and symptoms associated with lung cancer using survey data.  
Through exploratory data analysis and visualizations, the goal is to identify patterns and correlations that may help better understand potential risk indicators.

## Project Overview

Lung cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.  
This analysis investigates how common lifestyle habits and reported symptoms relate to lung cancer outcomes using a publicly available survey dataset.

Key questions explored include:
- Which lifestyle factors show stronger associations with lung cancer?
- Which symptoms are most commonly reported among individuals with lung cancer?
- Are some symptoms easily overlooked due to their similarity to minor illnesses?

## Dataset

- **Source:** Kaggle – *Survey Lung Cancer Dataset*
- **Description:**  
  The dataset contains survey responses related to age, gender, lifestyle habits (e.g., smoking), and reported health symptoms.
- **Size:** 300+ survey entries, 16 features

The dataset is included in this repository for reproducibility.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or VS Code
3. Run all cells top-to-bottom

All paths are relative, so the notebook should run on any machine without modification.
